My name is Jeffrey Yang Smith (he/him). I am currently a Data Science Master's student at Willamette University. 

My research interests include much of the natural sciences. I have previously done research at Western Washington University on the application of singular spectrum analysis to lake ice phenology under Prof. Kimihiro Noguchi, as well as the reduction of nitrogen oxides using ligand-based chemistry under Prof. John Gilbertson. I hope to do research in the field of biostatistics in the future.

I received my Bachelor's degree from WWU in Statistics and Chemistry (minor). In the fall, I will attend Oregon State University to pursue a Master's degree in Statistics.
